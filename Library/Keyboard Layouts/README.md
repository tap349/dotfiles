My steps:

- Open ABC Extended keyboard layout in Ukelele and save it to .keylayout file
- Run perl script from http://fwvdijk.org to turn ABC layout to Dvorak one
- Open it in Ukelele, hold Option and drag DOT ABOVE, MACRON and FULL STOP keys
  to where they are in original ABC Extended layout (w, a and x keys)
- Make new keys dead keys if they are not yet (dead keys are read in Ukelele).
  It might be necessary to do it one key at a time and then reopen Ukelele
